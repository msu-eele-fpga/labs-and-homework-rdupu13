# Lab 4: LED Patterns

## Overview
In this lab, I used reviewed VHDL techniques to test and synthesize an LED pattern state machine. The user can switch between hard-coded patterns by setting the switches to a binary number from 0 to 4 and pressing key 0. Functionality for the ARM processor to take over control was also implemented.

## Deliverables
Entity VHDL code is in the hdl/ folder along with testbenches.
