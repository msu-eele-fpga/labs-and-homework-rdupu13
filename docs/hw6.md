# Homework 6: Asychronous Conditioner

## Overview
I coded, simulated, and synthesized a pattern generator for LEDs in VHDL. An 8 bit array of LEDs shows the bits rotating around and counting, which is configured by my hierarchy of entities for generating patterns and displaying switch positions. A push button must be debounced and one-pulsed in order to be compatible with the state machine for controlling what the LEDs show.
